# CS565 - Human Computer Interaction

This class at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is focused on Crowd Sourcing and within that vast area, my group was focused on gathering design feedback from various online communities such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Reddit, Behance, Dribbble, Facebook and other personal social networks. 

This repository contains a sample portfolio written in HTML, CSS and JS of a CS student John Doe. We added this link and asked people on Amazon Mechanical Turk to provide feedback, paying them $0.10 cents each.

The portfolio is live at : <https://yagrawl.github.io/cs565/>

The feedback was rated on a 7 point Likert Scale, 1 being 'This is nonesense' and 7 is 'I need to implement this ASAP'.
More information on the findings - [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mCtI4MVj26c88rPcmEK5i0KMNhBVY49_0x97tHjsPJs/edit?usp=sharing)

Further probing into this subject : How would it affect the feedback if it was Jane Doe instead of John Doe?
